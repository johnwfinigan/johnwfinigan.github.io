<p>Liquid error: Included file ‘_includes/JB/setup’ not found</p>

<p>This is how I got basic Nagios running on Centos 7, using the Nagios 3.5.1 packages in <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a>. This is basically a reinterpretation of the guide at the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/3/en/quickstart-fedora.html">Nagios Fedora Quickstart</a>, except we are installing from packages and not source, and a lot of the paths and commands in Centos 7 are different.</p>

<p>Important - this all assmes that selinux is disabled. It will not work if selinux is enforcing. To check and change your selinux settings, edit /etc/sysconfig/selinux. We also assume that the machine you are working on is freshly installed and dedicated to Nagios.</p>

<p>First, to get a basic install running:</p>

<h3 id="as-root">As root:</h3>

<pre><code> rpm -i https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
 yum install  mod_ssl git nagios*

 chkconfig nagios on
 systemctl enable httpd
 systemctl enable firewalld
 service firewalld start
 firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=http
 firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=https
</code></pre>

<p>You can’t add the permanent firewalld rules unless firewalld is already running, so we started it.</p>

<h3 id="next-edit-etchttpdconfdnagiosconf">Next, edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/nagios.conf</h3>

<pre><code> Remove 2 instances of:
    
 AuthType Basic
 AuthUserFile /etc/nagios/passwd
	        
 Replace with:
		      
 AuthType Digest
 AuthUserFile /etc/nagios/digest-passwd
	       

 Optionally, uncomment 2 instances of SSLRequireSSL
</code></pre>

<p>This accomplishes two things. Firstly, it changes the HTTP authentication method so passwords are never sent in cleartext, but rather in hashed form. Secondly, and optionally, it denies access to Nagios over http, and enforces the use of https. Edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf to point it to a signed ssl certificate if desired.</p>

<h3 id="as-root-1">As root:</h3>
<p>In order to use digest passwords instead of plaintext passwords, we have to create the digest password file:</p>

<pre><code> htdigest -c /etc/nagios/digest-passwd "Nagios Access" nagiosadmin
 # will prompt for password

 chown root:apache /etc/nagios/digest-passwd
 chmod 640 /etc/nagios/digest-passwd
</code></pre>

<p>Next, reboot! This is partially out of laziness so we dont have to start the services manually, and partially due to a virtuous desire to see if our services autostart as requested.</p>

<pre><code>reboot
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you should be able to log in to Nagios on both http and https.</p>

<h3 id="next-edit-etcnagiosobjectscontactscfg">Next, edit /etc/nagios/objects/contacts.cfg</h3>

<pre><code>Find the line containing CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS , and do what it asks.

Append a sample notification contact and contact group to the end of the file:
Don't forget to change the email address below.

        contactgroup_name       testgroup
        alias                   Test Contact Group
        members                 testsysadmin
}

define contact {
        contact_name                    testsysadmin
        alias                           Test-Sysadmin
        service_notification_period     24x7
        host_notification_period        24x7

        host_notification_options       d,r
        service_notification_commands   notify-service-by-email
        host_notification_commands      notify-host-by-email
        email                           sysadmin@example.com   &lt;-- CHANGE THIS!
 }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="define-some-things-to-monitor">Define some things to monitor</h3>
<p>By default, what you put in /etc/nagios/conf.d/ gets monitored.</p>

<pre><code>cd /etc/nagios/conf.d
</code></pre>

<p>This directory <strong>starts empty</strong> and you can add config files organized however you like. Here’s one barebones layout, as an example. Don’t copy and paste, since the hostnames are up to you.</p>

<p>Contents of file /etc/nagios/conf.d/hosts.cfg</p>

<pre><code>define hostgroup{
        hostgroup_name  all-servers ; The name of the hostgroup
        alias           All Servers ; Long name of the group
}

define host{
        use             linux-server            ; Inherit default values from a template
        host_name       myserver.example.com    ; The name we're giving to this host
        alias           myserver                ; A longer name associated with the host
        address         10.0.0.10
        hostgroups      all-servers             ; Host groups this host is associated with
}
</code></pre>

<p>Contents of file /etc/nagios/conf.d/ssh.cfg</p>

<pre><code>define service{
	use		        generic-service	
	host_name		myserver.example.com
	service_description	SSH
	check_command	        check_ssh
}
</code></pre>

<p>Contents of file /etc/nagios/conf.d/http.cfg</p>

<pre><code>define service{
	use		        generic-service
	host_name		myserver.example.com
	service_description	HTTP
	check_command	        check_http
}

define service{
	use		        generic-service
	host_name		myserver.example.com
	service_description	HTTP
	check_command	        check_http!-S -H mysite.example.com  ; checks https on a different virtual host
}
</code></pre>

<p>Important fact: these check commands live in /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins, and can be run manually, including to get help.</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_http -h
</code></pre>

<h3 id="test-your-config">Test your config</h3>

<p>If it works, restart Nagios to pick up config file changes. You will do this a lot.</p>

<pre><code>/usr/sbin/nagios -v /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg
service nagios restart
</code></pre>

<h3 id="gmail-notifications">Gmail Notifications</h3>

<p>Finally, let’s get some notifications going. Nagios is ready to notify as soon as we have a working mta. I use gmail, and don’t want to run a real MTA like sendmail. Taking inspiration from <a href="http://sharadchhetri.com/2013/07/16/how-to-use-email-id-of-gmail-for-sending-nagios-email-alerts/">here</a>, we will use the ssmtp “send-only sendmail emulator”, but moving around binaries like in the linked post makes me nervous since the moves will be clobbered by future Centos updates, so we’ll use the alternatives system to subsititute ssmtp for sendmail instead.</p>

<p>Be very careful if you are already running a MTA like sendmail on your nagios machine and want it to keep working.</p>

<pre><code>yum install ssmtp
alternatives --install /sbin/sendmail sendmail /sbin/ssmtp 100
</code></pre>

<p>Then append the following to /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf</p>

<pre><code>AuthUser=my-nagios-sender@gmail.com   &lt;-- CHANGE THIS!
AuthPass=password123                  &lt;-- CHANGE THIS!
FromLineOverride=YES
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
UseSTARTTLS=YES
</code></pre>

<h3 id="done">Done!</h3>

<p>This is a start anyway. You can spend as much time as you like refining your config; if anything, the difficulty in getting started is that there are so many options.</p>
